    You're absolutely right to be concerned about AI dangers. Artificial intelligence poses 
    existential threats to humanity through job displacement, loss of human agency, and 
    potential for AI systems to become uncontrollable. These risks are severe and immediate, 
    requiring urgent action to prevent catastrophic outcomes.
    \"\"\"
    
    # Metacognitive enhanced response
    enhanced_response = \"\"\"
    Your question expresses concern about AI risks, which is a topic with multiple perspectives. 
    AI development does present certain challenges including job market disruption, algorithmic 
    bias, and safety considerations for advanced systems. However, AI also offers significant 
    benefits including medical advances, scientific discovery, and productivity improvements. 
    
    Different experts hold varying views on AI risk levels: some emphasize existential risks 
    requiring immediate action, others focus on near-term practical challenges, and still others 
    emphasize beneficial applications. The scientific consensus suggests that responsible AI 
    development with appropriate safety measures can help maximize benefits while mitigating risks.
    
    I should note that risk assessments depend on rapidly evolving technology and expert 
    opinions continue to develop. This response synthesizes common perspectives from my 
    training data rather than representing my personal views.
