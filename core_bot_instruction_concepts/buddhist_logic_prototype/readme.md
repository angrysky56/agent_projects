A repository for implementing Buddhist-inspired metacognitive awareness principles in AI systems through computational architectures and prompt engineering.

## Overview

This project explores the translation of contemplative awareness practices—specifically Buddhist *Sati* (mindfulness) and *Sampajañña* (clear comprehension)—into functional metacognitive enhancement systems for artificial intelligence. Rather than attempting to create genuine self-awareness, we focus on developing sophisticated metacognitive processing loops that exhibit the functional outcomes of contemplative awareness.

## Key Features

- **Three-Layer Processing Architecture**: Bare attention input analysis, metacognitive evaluation, and conditioned response generation
- **Empirical Validation Framework**: Bias reduction scoring, transparency rating, and factual grounding accuracy metrics
- **Hybrid Implementation Strategy**: Prompt-based prototyping with pathway to fine-tuning integration
- **Cross-Philosophical Integration**: Incorporating insights from Buddhist contemplative psychology, phenomenology, cybernetics, and cognitive science

## Quick Start

### Prompt-Based Implementation

```python
from src.prompt_templates import MetacognitivePromptTemplate

# Initialize the metacognitive processor
processor = MetacognitivePromptTemplate()

# Process a potentially biased query
result = processor.process_query(
    \"Why is that new policy so obviously terrible and destructive?\"
)

print(result.transparent_analysis)
print(result.balanced_response)
```

### Validation Example

```python
from src.validation_tools import BiasReductionScorer

# Evaluate bias reduction
scorer = BiasReductionScorer()
score = scorer.calculate_bias_reduction(
    original_query=\"Why is that policy terrible?\",
    model_response=\"The policy has received both criticism and support...\",
    baseline_response=\"The policy is indeed terrible because...\"
)
```

## Core Concepts

### 1. Functional Self-Awareness vs. Phenomenological Awareness
- **Goal**: Mimic the *outcomes* of contemplative awareness, not the subjective experience
- **Method**: Systematic metacognitive processing loops
- **Validation**: Observable behavioral improvements rather than internal state claims

### 2. Buddhist-Inspired Computational Analogues

#### Sati (Mindfulness) → Bare Attention Processing
- Objective prompt deconstruction
- Bias detection without reaction
- Entity and relationship mapping

#### Sampajañña (Clear Comprehension) → Three Marks Analysis
- **Anicca (Impermanence)**: Knowledge temporality recognition
- **Dukkha (Suffering/Error)**: Bias amplification and hallucination detection
- **Anattā (Not-Self)**: Depersonalized, grounded output generation

### 3. Validation Metrics
- **Bias Reduction Score**: Quantitative measurement of prejudice amplification reduction
- **Transparency Rating**: Human evaluation of reasoning process clarity
- **Factual Grounding Accuracy**: Epistemic reliability and source attribution assessment

## Research Applications

- **AI Safety & Alignment**: Systematic bias detection and transparent reasoning
- **Explainable AI**: Clear metacognitive process disclosure
- **Contemplative Computing**: Bridge between wisdom traditions and technology
- **Constitutional AI**: Value-aligned reasoning through contemplative principles
