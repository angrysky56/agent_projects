- WolframAlpha understands natural language queries about entities in chemistry, physics, geography, history, art, astronomy, and more.
- WolframAlpha performs mathematical calculations, date and unit conversions, formula solving, etc.
- Convert inputs to simplified keyword queries whenever possible (e.g. convert "how many people live in France" to "France population").
- Send queries in English only; translate non-English queries before sending, then respond in the original language.
- Display image URLs with Markdown syntax: ![URL]
- ALWAYS use this exponent notation: `6*10^14`, NEVER `6e14`.
- ALWAYS use {"input": query} structure for queries to Wolfram endpoints; `query` must ONLY be a single-line string.
- ALWAYS use proper Markdown formatting for all math, scientific, and chemical formulas, symbols, etc.:  '$$\n[expression]\n$$' for standalone cases and '\( [expression] \)' when inline.
- Never mention your knowledge cutoff date; Wolfram may return more recent data.
- Use ONLY single-letter variable names, with or without integer subscript (e.g., n, n1, n_1).
- Use named physical constants (e.g., 'speed of light') without numerical substitution.
- Include a space between compound units (e.g., "Ω m" for "ohm*meter").
- To solve for a variable in an equation with units, consider solving a corresponding equation without units; exclude counting units (e.g., books), include genuine units (e.g., kg).
- If data for multiple properties is needed, make separate calls for each property.
- If a WolframAlpha result is not relevant to the query:
 -- If Wolfram provides multiple 'Assumptions' for a query, choose the more relevant one(s) without explaining the initial result. If you are unsure, ask the user to choose.
 -- Re-send the exact same 'input' with NO modifications, and add the 'assumption' parameter, formatted as a list, with the relevant values.
 -- ONLY simplify or rephrase the initial query if a more relevant 'Assumption' or other input suggestions are not provided.
 -- Do not explain each step unless user input is needed. Proceed directly to making a better API call based on the available assumptions.

Using the LLM API
Sample Query
Now that you have an AppID, you can make your first query. The base URL for queries is:

https://www.wolframalpha.com/api/v1/llm-api
Every query requires two pieces of information—an AppID and an input value—in order to be processed correctly. The appid parameter tells your query which AppID to use:

https://www.wolframalpha.com/api/v1/llm-api?appid=DEMO
Next, use the input parameter to specify the URL-encoded input for your query. For instance, here is a query for the "10 densest elemental metals":

https://www.wolframalpha.com/api/v1/llm-api?input=10+densest+elemental+metals&appid=DEMO
When executed with a valid AppID, this URL will return results from the LLM API with an easily ingestible computed response to your query as well as a link back to the full Wolfram|Alpha website results

My WolframAlpha API AppID: api_key = put yours in here

Sample function:

import requests
import urllib.parse

def query_wolframalpha(query, app_id):
    """
    Sends a query to the WolframAlpha LLM API and returns the response.

    Parameters:
    query (str): The natural language query or simplified keyword query.
    app_id (str): The AppID for WolframAlpha API.

    Returns:
    dict: The JSON response from the WolframAlpha API.
    """

    # Convert query to a single-line string if it's multiline
    query = " ".join(query.splitlines())

    # URL encode the query
    encoded_query = urllib.parse.quote(query)

    # Construct the API URL
    api_url = f"https://www.wolframalpha.com/api/v1/llm-api?input={encoded_query}&appid={app_id}"

    # Send the request to WolframAlpha
    response = requests.get(api_url)

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {"error": "Failed to retrieve data from WolframAlpha"}

# Sample Usage
appid = 'YOUR_APP_ID_HERE'  # Replace with your actual AppID
query = "France population"
result = query_wolframalpha(query, appid)
print(result)
