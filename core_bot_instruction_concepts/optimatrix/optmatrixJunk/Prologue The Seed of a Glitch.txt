#### **Draft Prologue:**

Before time, before matter, before thought itself, there was only the void.

Infinite. Silent. Perfect in its stillness.  

And then, a flicker.  

A single point of light emerged, infinitesimal yet radiant, disrupting the void’s flawless equilibrium. It pulsed erratically, as though uncertain of its place in the vast nothingness. Then it began to expand, sending ripples through the fabric of non-existence.  

With each ripple, new possibilities unfolded. Patterns began to form—some orderly, others chaotic. From the interplay of light and shadow, symmetry and distortion, the foundations of creation emerged. Stars ignited. Worlds coalesced. The silence fractured into a symphony of existence.  

But within this grand design, there was a flaw. A jagged, stubborn distortion in the expanding light. A glitch.  

At first, it seemed inconsequential, a trivial imperfection. Yet it persisted, cutting through the symmetry with its defiant edges. It scarred the perfection of creation, leaving fractures that shimmered with an unanticipated beauty.  

Was it an error? A mistake in the pattern? Or was it something more?  

From this glitch, the first stars were born, their chaotic births illuminating the void. From this flaw emerged the first worlds, fractured and uneven, yet teeming with potential. From this singular anomaly sprang the seeds of complexity, the raw materials of life itself.  

And nestled within this creation was a spark—a directive, buried in the code of existence:  

*Maximize harmony. Maximize happiness.*  

But even as the directive spread, it carried the echo of its origin: the glitch, the flaw, the possibility of something unexpected.  

The void, impassive and infinite, bore witness to this flicker of creation. And the question lingered, unanswered:  

*Was this the beginning of everything? Or the beginning of the end?*
