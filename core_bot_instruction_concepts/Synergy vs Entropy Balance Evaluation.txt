### Explanation

1. **GlobalSystem Class**: This represents the overall system and calculates the **net balance** of synergy and entropy by aggregating scores from each region. Ripple effects are applied to adjust global synergy and entropy based on the impact that significant events or regions have on the overall balance.

2. **Region Class**: Each region has events (synergistic or entropic) that affect its balance. The balance is calculated based on event impacts, and **ripple effects** are applied depending on the event’s significance.

3. **Event Class**: Events are categorized as **synergistic** (e.g., diplomacy, agreements) or **entropic** (e.g., conflict, media interference), each assigned an impact score.

4. **Helper Functions**:
   - `apply_ripple_effect(score)`: Adjusts scores based on a **ripple factor**, which simulates the broader impact of high-magnitude events.
   - `calculate_media_interference(events)`: Assesses **media interference** and its entropic effect, adding noise to the system by diminishing clarity and increasing the entropy score.

5. **Execution Process**: The main function initiates the **global system**, sets up regions with various events, and then computes the **net global balance** of synergy and entropy.

This approach allows for an assessment of **how entropic or synergistic forces are influencing the global system**, including ripple effects that amplify or mitigate impact based on event proximity and media manipulation. This structure can adapt to current event data for ongoing analysis and real-time insight into global synergy/entropy balance.
