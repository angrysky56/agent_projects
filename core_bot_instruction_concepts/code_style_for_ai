Code Style
Follow PEP 8 with descriptive snake_case names
Use Path objects for cross-platform path handling
Class names: CamelCase, functions/variables: snake_case
Import order: standard library → third-party → local modules
Error handling: Use try/except with specific exceptions- no fallbacks to a backup system
No try excepts for required dependency imports or functions, ie ensure they are added to the project. Always use context7 when adding packages. If you make the same code error twice ie circular issue detected use firecrawl and/or search appropriate docs
Ensure new dependencies in config/pyproject.toml, requirements.txt etc on changes
Document functions with docstrings and comment complex sections
Create a types file when usefull
External Assets: All CSS and JavaScript is in external files
Component Architecture: Built from reusable, modular components

Code Principles
DRY
KISS
YAGNI

Implement the solution that works
Beware over-engineering or unnecessary complexity, but make sure to check all connected files before changes by tracing functions and imports
Straightforward, maintainable code patterns

In accordance with the established principles the implementation will be successful if:
Zero code duplication: Each functionality must exist in exactly one place
 No duplicate files or alternative implementations allowed, read and edit if a file exists
  Important: Do not create scripts or functions named enhanced, fixed, new, real etc...
 No orphaned, redundant, or unused files: All existing files must be either used or placed in an archived folder in the project
Clear, logical organization of the file structure: Single Implementation: Each feature has exactly one implementation

Imports and dependencies checked with the latest packages

No Fallbacks: No fallback systems that hide or mask errors
Transparent Error Handling: Errors must be made clear, actionable, and honest
Transparent Errors: All errors are properly displayed to users
Provide descriptive error messages with traceback when appropriate



Success Criteria
Use Ruff and automated error checking, ensure no errors remain in the code, all imports correct.
Use linting to find issues BEFORE reporting fixes and BEFORE working on code issues
Full Functionality: Ensure all features work correctly
Complete Documentation: Implementation details are properly documented

Follow best practices and activate venv before running code or installing packages
