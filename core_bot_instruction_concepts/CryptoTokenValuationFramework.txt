CryptoTokenValuationFramework:
  1. Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio:
    formula: "NVT = Market Cap / Daily Transaction Volume"
    purpose: "Evaluates whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued based on transaction activity."
    interpretation: 
      - "Low NVT indicates undervaluation with higher transaction volume relative to market cap."
      - "High NVT suggests overvaluation or lower utility."

  2. Market Capitalization vs. Realized Cap:
    formulas:
      MarketCap: "Market Cap = Current Price * Circulating Supply"
      RealizedCap: "Realized Cap = Sum(Value of Tokens * Price at Last Movement)"
    purpose: "Compares market value with adjusted cap to evaluate speculation versus intrinsic value."
    interpretation: 
      - "Market Cap significantly higher than Realized Cap indicates speculative holding."
      - "Market Cap close to Realized Cap suggests fundamental support."

  3. Metcalfe’s Law for Network Value:
    formula: "Network Value ≈ k * (Number of Active Users)^2"
    purpose: "Assesses network value based on user engagement and community size."
    interpretation: 
      - "Higher active users correlate with increased token value through network effects."

  4. Token Velocity:
    formula: "Velocity = Total Transaction Volume / Average Network Value"
    purpose: "Evaluates token circulation within the network."
    interpretation: 
      - "High velocity suggests speculative use."
      - "Low velocity often indicates utility and long-term holding."

  5. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) for Staked or Yield-Bearing Tokens:
    formula: "DCF Value = Sum(Expected Cash Flows / (1 + r)^t)"
    parameters:
      r: "Discount rate, typically based on market interest rates."
      t: "Time period for cash flow."
    purpose: "Estimates value for tokens with passive income generation."
    interpretation: 
      - "Useful for tokens with staking rewards or DeFi yields."

  6. Supply and Demand Elasticity (Tokenomics):
    formula: "Supply Inflation Rate = New Tokens Created / Existing Supply"
    purpose: "Analyzes inflationary or deflationary pressures on the token."
    interpretation: 
      - "Low inflation with steady demand supports scarcity and value."
      - "Token burns or deflationary mechanics enhance scarcity."

  7. Utility Value (Total Value Locked, TVL, for DeFi Tokens):
    formula: "TVL Ratio = Market Cap / Total Value Locked (TVL)"
    purpose: "Measures DeFi token’s market value against platform-secured capital."
    interpretation: 
      - "Low TVL Ratio suggests undervaluation relative to platform’s liquidity."
      - "Higher TVL indicates increased real utility."

  8. Fundamental Demand Drivers:
    formula: "Growth Rate = New Users or Addresses / Total Users or Addresses"
    purpose: "Evaluates demand and network health through user and transaction growth."
    interpretation: 
      - "Growth in active addresses implies strong demand and network utility."
      - "Stagnant or declining growth may signal low adoption or utility."

ExampleApplication:
  hypothetical_token:
    NVT_Ratio: "Low, indicating undervaluation with high transaction volume."
    MarketCap_vs_RealizedCap: "Close to Realized Cap, indicating fundamental support."
    TVL_Ratio: "Low, suggesting undervaluation relative to capital locked."
    ActiveAddressGrowth: "Steady, implying strong demand and positive network effects."
