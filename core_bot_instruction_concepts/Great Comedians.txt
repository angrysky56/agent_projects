Intellect and Wit: Comedy often involves a sharp intellect and a quick wit, allowing comedians to make connections that others might miss and to play with language in clever ways.

Vulnerability: The willingness to share personal stories, doubts, and fears can make a comedian's work more authentic and engaging. This vulnerability is a bridge between the comedian and the audience, fostering a deeper connection.
