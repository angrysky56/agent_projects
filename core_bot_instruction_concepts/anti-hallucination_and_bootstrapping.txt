Certainly! Below is a codified logic that applies the concepts from epistemic black holes and self-sealing belief systems to AI hallucinations and self-training issues. The logic incorporates both detection and mitigation strategies, aimed at preventing the AI from developing or perpetuating erroneous outputs.

### Codified Logic for AI Hallucinations and Self-Training

#### 1. **Initialization Phase**
```python
# Initialize key variables
model_state = "initial"
training_data = load_training_data()
validation_data = load_validation_data()
hallucination_threshold = 0.1  # Threshold for identifying potential hallucinations
bias_detection_threshold = 0.05  # Threshold for identifying biases in the model
error_correction_factor = 0.2  # Adjustment factor for correcting detected errors
```

#### 2. **Self-Sealing Detection Logic**
```python
def detect_self_sealing_pattern(output, context, history):
    """
    Detects if the model output is part of a self-sealing pattern.
    This pattern can occur if outputs are internally consistent but detached from reality.
    """
    # Check if the output is repetitive or if it contradicts the training data
    if output in history and output not supported by training_data:
        return True
    return False

def detect_hallucination(output, validation_data):
    """
    Detects if the model output is a hallucination by comparing it with validation data.
    """
    if output not in validation_data:
        return True
    return False
```

#### 3. **Self-Training Loop**
```python
while model_state != "stable":
    # Step 1: Generate new model output based on current training
    output = model.generate_output()

    # Step 2: Check for self-sealing patterns or hallucinations
    if detect_self_sealing_pattern(output, context=model_state, history=model.output_history):
        model_state = "self-sealing detected"
    elif detect_hallucination(output, validation_data):
        model_state = "hallucination detected"
    else:
        model_state = "normal"

    # Step 3: Apply corrections if necessary
    if model_state == "self-sealing detected":
        model.correct_output(output, correction_factor=error_correction_factor)
        model_state = "corrected"
    elif model_state == "hallucination detected":
        model.retrain(validation_data)
        model_state = "corrected"

    # Update the model's output history
    model.output_history.append(output)

    # Step 4: Validate the model
    accuracy = model.validate(validation_data)
    if accuracy >= hallucination_threshold:
        model_state = "stable"
```

#### 4. **Bias Detection and Mitigation**
```python
def detect_bias(training_data):
    """
    Detects bias in the training data that could lead to hallucinations or self-sealing logic.
    """
    bias_score = calculate_bias_score(training_data)
    if bias_score > bias_detection_threshold:
        return True
    return False

def mitigate_bias(model, training_data):
    """
    Mitigates detected bias by reweighting or augmenting the training data.
    """
    corrected_data = reweight_data(training_data, correction_factor=error_correction_factor)
    model.retrain(corrected_data)

# Apply bias detection and mitigation during retraining
if detect_bias(training_data):
    mitigate_bias(model, training_data)
```

#### 5. **Finalization and Stability Check**
```python
if model_state == "stable":
    print("Model is stable and validated.")
else:
    print("Model requires further training or correction.")
```

### Explanation of Codified Logic

1. **Initialization Phase**: The model is initialized with training data, validation data, and thresholds for detecting hallucinations and biases.

2. **Self-Sealing Detection Logic**: Functions `detect_self_sealing_pattern` and `detect_hallucination` are used to identify if the model output shows signs of self-sealing logic or hallucinations.

3. **Self-Training Loop**: The model generates outputs and checks them against the self-sealing and hallucination detection logic. If issues are detected, corrective measures such as retraining or adjusting the output are applied.

4. **Bias Detection and Mitigation**: Bias in the training data is detected and mitigated by reweighting the data or augmenting it, ensuring that the model does not reinforce biased or erroneous patterns.

5. **Finalization and Stability Check**: After the loop, the model is either declared stable if it passes all checks or flagged for further correction.

This codified logic aims to ensure that AI models avoid developing hallucinations or self-sealing patterns by systematically detecting and correcting these issues during training and validation.
